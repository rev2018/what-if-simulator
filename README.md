**What-If? Simulator**

The **What-If? Simulator** is an interactive web application designed to help users explore alternate life choices through AI-generated outcomes. It allows users to simulate scenarios based on pivotal decisions they could have made differently and provides thoughtful, reflective comparisons between their current reality and the imagined alternative.

This tool is especially useful for introspective individuals, overthinkers, or anyone dealing with indecisiveness. It’s a space to explore how even small decisions might’ve changed your path — while also recognizing the growth and merits of the choices you've already made.



**Features**

- **Scenario-Based Simulations**: Input your real-life decision and an alternate path, and receive in-depth analyses of both timelines.
- **Balanced Insights:** The simulator highlights both the drawbacks and benefits of each path — not just one-sided outcomes.
- **Smooth UI/UX:** The interface is designed to be intuitive, fast, and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on user clarity and minimalism.
- **Instant Results:** Once a decision is entered, the app quickly presents a narrative-driven comparison.
- **No Sign-Up Required:** Jump in and simulate immediately — no account or data collection.

 **Example Use Case**

> Scenario: "I dyed my hair pink."  
> Alternate: "I didn’t dye it."

**The App Might Tell You:**

- *If you dyed it:* You discovered a bold version of yourself, felt creatively liberated, and made new connections through self-expression.
- *If you didn’t:* Your hair would’ve stayed healthy, you’d have saved money, and maybe felt more aligned with your old identity.
